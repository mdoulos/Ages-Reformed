 # Age Painting Descriptions
 pic_age_of_feudalism_desc: "The Archoros City, Merl1ncz, 2007\n\nPictured is an artist's interpretation of a typical European medieval city during the age of feudalism. Feudalism is hard to define, but roughly describes a widespread political system in the 9th through 16th centuries that saw decentralized societies managed through a number of minor lords, each owing allegiance and military service to the lord above them as vassals. These lords typically owned land, castles, and soldiers and were expected to come together under the king's banner in time of war. Under them, most of society lived as serfs or peasants, though many others lived as merchants and artisans in the ever-growing towns and cities.\n\nKings and emperors had much less centralized control over the land and had to rely on the fealty or allegiance of their vassals. This would change due to the introduction of gunpowder weapons, as cannons ensured that rich nobles and kings could effectively break the resistance of obstinate minor lords, thus allowing them greater ability to consolidate their personal power and would lead to the creation of centralized states."
